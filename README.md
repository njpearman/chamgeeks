# ChamGeeks!

This is the source code for the [chamgeeks.com](https://www.chamgeeks.com) website.  It is built with Ruby on Rails.  The app is pretty standard, but uses Slim for view templating and pure JavaScript instead of CoffeeScript for the front-end.  The CSS manifest file is Sass, not CSS.

The application is deployed using [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/rails) with [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for "secrets", and runs in production on [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma).

## Style

The pages use the Monserrat font from [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com) and a modified version of [Unicorn UI buttons](http://unicorn-ui.com/buttons/builder/) for the rounded buttons.
